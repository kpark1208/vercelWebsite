    const enhancedDescription = `A comprehensive implementation of the Naive Bayes classification algorithm in C++, demonstrating probabilistic machine learning concepts for text classification and pattern recognition. 

THEORY & APPROACH:
This project addressed the challenge of text classification using probabilistic machine learning. The core theoretical foundation involved understanding Bayes' theorem, conditional probability, and the 'naive' independence assumption. The design approach focused on mathematical rigor, computational efficiency, and modularity, implementing probability smoothing and memory optimization for large datasets.

TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE:
The system architecture follows a modular pattern with clear separation between data preprocessing, probability calculation, and classification. Key implementation details include log-space probability calculations to prevent numerical underflow, memory-efficient storage using sparse data structures, and support for multiple smoothing techniques.

CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS:
1. Numerical Precision: Implemented log-space calculations to prevent floating-point underflow
2. Unseen Features: Applied Laplace smoothing to handle features not seen during training
3. Memory Efficiency: Used sparse data structures and lazy evaluation for large datasets

LESSONS LEARNED:
This project deepened my understanding of probabilistic machine learning and numerical stability in algorithm design. The development process reinforced the value of modular design and mathematical validation. Future improvements would include more sophisticated smoothing techniques and real-time learning capabilities.`
